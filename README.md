## Background

Wikipedia has more than 27 million registered patrons who rely on its knowledge-base for essential encyclopedic information. Goodreads similarly has a community of more than 90 million book-loving patrons. But there isn't a website which combines the two and lets the world work together to grow a shared graph of books notes.
